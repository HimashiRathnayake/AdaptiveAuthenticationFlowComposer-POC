# Authentication Flow Composer - POC

This is a POC of my internship project, Authentication Flow Composer.

Authentication Flow Composer is a UI based tool to design and configure the authentication flow by providing the required steps and conditions for authentication easily through the UI itself. This allows you to define authentication flows with no prior syntax knowledge.

You can find the actual project development repo in [identity-authentication-flow-composer](https://github.com/wso2-incubator/identity-authentication-flow-composer)

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.
